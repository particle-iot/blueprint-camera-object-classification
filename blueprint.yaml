introduction: |
  Integrate Edge Impulse’s ML with Particle devices to classify objects from a connected camera in real time.

description: |
  This project demonstrates how to use Edge Impulse to classify objects in front of a camera connected to Particle devices like the Photon 2 or M-SoM. With Edge Impulse’s machine learning capabilities, this project can recognize and classify objects in real time, ideal for smart home systems, security applications, and more.

  Key Features:
  - Edge Impulse Integration: Leverage Edge Impulse’s ML models to detect objects.
  - Device Compatibility: Compatible with Particle Photon 2, Boron, and M-SoM devices.
  - Customizable Model: Pre-trained to detect lamps, plants, and pianos, but can be easily retrained to identify other objects.
  
  Steps include:
  - Hardware Setup: Connect a uCAM-III camera module to your Particle device.
  - Data Collection: Use Edge Impulse to gather and label training images.
  - Model Training: Train a custom model on Edge Impulse for object detection.
  - Deployment: Deploy the model on Particle and start recognizing objects in real-time.
